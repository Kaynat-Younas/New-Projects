    <p>Angela Yu is the founder of applications development course the London App Brewery. ... She co-founded the London App Brewery after wishing she could improve NHS technology and taught herself programming in order to take part in a number of wide-scale initiatives to improve tech and systems within the NHS.My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game. Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my <a href="about.html"> greatest passion is teaching</a>

        I spend most of my <a href="about.html">time researching</a> how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand. I apply everything <a href="about.html">I discover into my bootcamp courses</a> In my courses, <a href="about.html">you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of explanations and animations</a> to make <a href="about.html">sure everything</a> is easy to understand.
        
       <a href="about.html"> I'll be there </a>for you every step of the way.</p>
